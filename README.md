# California State Timber Harvest Planning Regions Since 2010 Compared with Government Agency Controlled Lands

The Timber Harvest Plan THP regions are seen in red. They are representative of privately held timber lands primarily in Northern Ca. The federal, state, local, NGO, and tribal lands are in yellow, light green, kelly green, aqua, and blue respectively. 

### Data References

1) Data was collected from CALFIRE & BIOS:
CALFIRE:
- ownership18_2.gdb (agency gdb)
- Cnty18_2 (county gdb)
CALFIRE/BIOS:
- Title Timber Harvest Plan Boundaries - Statewide [ds816]
- Publication date 2018-04-0800:00:00
- ftp://ftp.fire.ca.gov/forest/Statewide_Timber_Harvest/

2) Map was assembled, symbolized and completed in QGIS.

3) The map was then exported using qgis2web and leaflet
  - Issues: QGIS crashed when using qgis2web interface with the complete THP harvest dataset. 
    I had to use a subset and a very simple map to make the program export completely. 

4) The map was imbedded using iframe. 

5) Finally it was submitted via link to url.
